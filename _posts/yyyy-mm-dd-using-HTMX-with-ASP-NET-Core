HTMX is a powerful library that provides enhanced functionality, such as AJAX and DOM updates, to your web pages. Unlike traditional JavaScript coding, HTMX offers a simpler approach by allowing you to incorporate these features through specific attributes within your HTML markup.

To illustrate this concept, let's examine the following example taken from the HTMX website:

```html
<button hx-post="/clicked" hx-swap="outerHTML">
    Click Me
</button>
```
In this code snippet, we have a button element accompanied by two additional hx-* attributes.

The hx-post attribute instructs HTMX to initiate an HTTP POST request to the "/clicked" URL when the user clicks on the button.
The hx-swap attribute directs HTMX to replace the button element with the content obtained from the response of this request.

In the upcoming blog posts of this series, we will delve deeper into the functionality of HTMX. However, if you desire a more comprehensive understanding of HTMX, you can consult the HTMX documentation.

Adding HTMX to an ASP.NET Core application can be done swiftly by referencing the script via UNPKG. To accomplish this, simply include the following script tag in the Razor Pages where you intend to utilize HTMX:
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.2" integrity="sha384-L6OqL9pRWyyFU3+/bjdSri+iIphTN/bvYyM37tICVyOJkWZLpP2vGn6VUEXgzg6h" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```
The provided script utilizes version 1.9.2, but for the most recent version and installation instructions, you can refer to the installation section on the HTMX website.
